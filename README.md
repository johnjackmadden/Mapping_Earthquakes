# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using javascript and geojson functions present in leaflet, I created an interactive map displaying earthquake activity over the past 7 days, showing the magnitude and location of each earthquake.  Results can be toggled to display only major quakes greater than magnitude 4.5, all earthquakes, and/or tectonic plate boundaries. Dark and Steer mode are enabled
